# Notes App

A simple and interactive notes app built with Flutter. It allows users to add, edit, delete, search, and manage notes with different priorities and status (e.g., pinned, favorite, hidden). The app uses `SharedPreferences` to store the notes locally on the device.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Add new notes with a title, content, and priority (High, Medium, Low).
- **Search Notes**: Search for notes by title or content.
- **Manage Notes**: Pin, hide, or favorite notes for better organization.
- **Delete Notes**: Select multiple notes and delete them permanently.
- **Priority Management**: Display notes with color-coded priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
- **Local Storage**: Notes are saved locally using `SharedPreferences` and persist even after app restarts.
- **Custom UI**: Beautiful UI with modern card designs, checkboxes for selection, and a gradient app bar.
